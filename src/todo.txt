Short term todo (before next 0.9.1 release):
* http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=157
* test url links
* src version of zlib
* maybe: remember default bookmarks state
* maybe: remember and restore size and position of the window

Things to do before 1.0 release:
* test search more and make sure it works better (currently mupdf seems to have
  problems converting some text to their real value)
* intelligent resizing so that the window takes as much space as possible on the
  screen (kind of like maximize, but doesn't actually maximizes the window but
  takes max dx or dy space available and proportional amount of the other axis)
* TOC improvements:
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
* maybe: option to disable update check (some people still don't have broadband?)

Long term todo:
* find improvements:
  * better/different buttons for next/prev find
* crash reporting with breakpad
 - on startup check for crash dumps and tries to submit them. Delete crash file
   (even if submission failed)
* preserve fullScreen info per document and respect it when opening a PDF
* move DisplayState into DisplayModel and use it directly, instead of 
  duplicating the fields in DisplayModel. Rename to SerializedState.
* better, animated about screen
* make dialog-boxes translatable
* replace DString with something better (sstr ?) and provide C++ wrapper
  to make it easier to use in C++ code without all those annoying DStringInit()
  calls
* printing improvements
* add lemmings
* don't use GWL_USERDATA to store WindowInfo pointer, use 
  WindowInfo_FindByHwnd() instead (to avoid crashes due to lifetime issues
  of windows and WindowInfo structs)

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* DisplayState::visible could be removed. It was used when we were automatically
  reopening previously opened files, but we don't do it anymore, so we don't
  have to track it.
* maybe: remove link-time dependency on msimg32.dll (has AlphaBlend, GradientFill
  and TransparentBlt). Instead, dynamically load the functions. Needed for
  working on NT. On the other hand: is NT worth supporting?
* show keybindings in help
