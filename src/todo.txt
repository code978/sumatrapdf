Maybe for 1.3:
* a button to switch mouse between dragging and text selection, like in Adobe Reader
  and FoxIt. The current way with Ctrl is not discoverable enough
* add menu option to create a crashdump on crash and submit it to a website
  with a note about what happened. This is meant to make it easier to get
  callstacks for the crashes from people who experience crashes I can't
  reproduce. This should be an opt-in, disabled by default, because otherwise
  I suspect I would get too many crash reports since Sumatra is quite popular.

Long term todo:
* intelligent resizing so that the window takes as much space as possible on the
  screen (kind of like maximize, but doesn't actually maximizes the window but
  takes max dx or dy space available and proportional amount of the other axis)
* find improvements:
  * better/different buttons for next/prev find
* move DisplayState into DisplayModel and use it directly, instead of 
  duplicating the fields in DisplayModel. Rename to SerializedState.

Maybe:
* show keybindings in help
