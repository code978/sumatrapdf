Short term todo (before next 0.8.1 release):
* remember last update date and only automatically check for update if at least 
  a day passed
* generate unique guid and remember it in preferences
* remember number of open pdfs
* send guid and number of open pdfs with version check

Long term todo:
* finish find
  * better/different buttons for next/prev find
* crash reporting with breakpad
 - on startup check for crash dumps and tries to submit them. Delete crash file
   (even if submission failed)
* remember and restore size and position of the window
* finish TOC:
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
* preserve fullScreen info per document and respect it when opening a PDF
* useFitz should also be remembered per file and when switching rendering
  engine, we should only re-load current file.
* intelligent resizing so that the window takes as much space as possible on the
  screen (kind of like maximize, but doesn't actually maximizes the window but
  takes max dx or dy space available and proportional amount of the other axis)
* don't use GWL_USERDATA to store WindowInfo pointer, use 
  WindowInfo_FindByHwnd() instead (to avoid crashes due to lifetime issues
  of windows and WindowInfo structs)
* handle links
* move DisplayState into DisplayModel and use it directly, instead of 
  duplicating the fields in DisplayModel. Rename to SerializedState.
* show keybindings in help
* better, animated about screen
* make dialog-boxes translatable
* replace DString with something better (sstr ?) and provide C++ wrapper
  to make it easier to use in C++ code without all those annoying DStringInit()
  calls
* remove poppler, always use fitz

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* DisplayState::visible could be removed. It was used when we were automatically
  reopening previously opened files, but we don't do it anymore, so we don't
  have to track it.
* maybe: remove link-time dependency on msimg32.dll (has AlphaBlend, GradientFill
  and TransparentBlt). Instead, dynamically load the functions. Needed for
  working on NT. On the other hand: is NT worth supporting?
