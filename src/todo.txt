Things to do before 1.0 release:

Long term todo:
* intelligent resizing so that the window takes as much space as possible on the
  screen (kind of like maximize, but doesn't actually maximizes the window but
  takes max dx or dy space available and proportional amount of the other axis)
* TOC improvements:
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
* find improvements:
  * better/different buttons for next/prev find
* move DisplayState into DisplayModel and use it directly, instead of 
  duplicating the fields in DisplayModel. Rename to SerializedState.
* printing improvements

Maybe:
* show keybindings in help
