Short term todo (before next 0.8 release):
* finish find
  * better/different buttons for next/prev find
* crash reporting with breakpad
 - on startup check for crash dumps and tries to submit them. Delete crash file
   (even if submission failed)
* check for new version on-line
* finish TOC:
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
  * when TOC is shown, keyboard navigation shortcuts don't work. We need to
    be smarter about focus handling
  * remember toc state for a given document in prefs
* preserve fullScreen info per document and respect it when opening a PDF
* bug: going into fullscreen mode on my laptop/Win XP doesn't cover the whole
  screen (upper part of the size of start bar is not used)
* bug: on second window, next/prev buttons are not positioned correctly
  (overlap with Find: label)
* fullscreen mode should be per window, not global to the app

Long term todo:
* handle links
* move DisplayState into DisplayModel and use it directly, instead of 
  duplicating the fields in DisplayModel. Rename to SerializedState.
* show keybindings in help
* better, animated about screen
* a nicer way to show selected text
* make dialog-boxes translatable
* replace DString with something better (sstr ?) and provide C++ wrapper
  to make it easier to use in C++ code without all those annoying DStringInit()
  calls
* move fitz code to a separate Google code project (fitz-kjk?) and link to it
  via svn:externals, like we do for poppler. fitz should be trunk and fitz-head
  should become branches/devel. Add standalone makefiles etc. so that it can
  be tested and worked on independently of Sumatra. Preserving history of
  changes for fitz code might be challenging - I'm not sure if google import
  will handle 2 branches. In the worst case I can write a script to reply
  checkins.

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* update poppler to latest version
* speedup poppler
* improve fitz to handle more PDFs
* DisplayState::visible could be removed. It was used when we were automatically
  reopening previously opened files, but we don't do it anymore, so we don't
  have to track it.
