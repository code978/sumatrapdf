Short term todo (before next 0.7 release):

Long term todo:
* find
* show table of contents
* check for new version on-line
* crash reporting with breakpad
* show keybindings in help
* better, animated about screen
* a nicer way to show selected text
* make dialog-boxes translatable

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* update poppler to latest version
