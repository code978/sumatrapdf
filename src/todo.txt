Short term todo (before next 0.8 release):
* finish find
  * add next/previous buttons
* crash reporting with breakpad
 - on startup check for crash dumps and tries to submit them. Delete crash file
   (even if submission failed)
* check for new version on-line
* finish TOC:
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
  * when TOC is shown, keyboard navigation shortcuts don't work. We need to
    be smarter about focus handling
  * remember toc state for a given document in prefs
* preserve fullScreen info per document and respect it when opening a PDF
* bug: going into fullscreen mode on my laptop/Win XP doesn't cover the whole
  screen (upper part of the size of start bar is not used)

Long term todo:
* show keybindings in help
* better, animated about screen
* a nicer way to show selected text
* make dialog-boxes translatable
* handle links
* replace DString with something better (sstr ?) and provide C++ wrapper
  to make it easier to use in C++ code without all those annoying DStringInit()
  calls

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* update poppler to latest version
* speedup poppler
* improve fitz to handle more PDFs
