Short term todo (before next 0.8 release):
* finish find
  * add next/previous buttons
  * "Find:" label needs to be transparrent so it looks right on XP's toolbar
  * Ctrl-F as a keyboard shortcut
* crash reporting with breakpad
* use bencoding for preferences instead of ad-hoc text format
* check for new version on-line
* finish TOC:
  * menu item for TOC
  * an easy way to close TOC (I like the header with close button like in
    e editor http://www.e-texteditor.com/wiki/index.php/Projects)
  * when TOC is shown, keyboard navigation shortcuts don't work. We need to
    be smarter about focus handling
* bug: menu handling is broken when more then one window is opened and then
  closed. We need create separate menu for each window

Long term todo:
* show keybindings in help
* better, animated about screen
* a nicer way to show selected text
* make dialog-boxes translatable

Maybe:
* use MultiByteToWideChar() 
  (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776413.aspx) with CP_UTF8
  for utf8->utf16 conversion
* update poppler to latest version
* speedup poppler
* improve fitz to handle more PDFs
