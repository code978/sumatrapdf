Things to do before 2.0 release:

Specific things that still need to be added for minimal mobi support:
- save and restore last position in the mobi file

Maybe for 2.0:
- progress bar flicker when status line changes width (I think). We probably force repaint after
  re-layout in mui even if position/sizes of controls haven't changed
- even more mobi document properties

Things that can wait for 2.1:
- links in mobi format
- lists in mobi format (ul, li)
- search in mobi
- fullscreen for mobi
- printing from mobi
- better way of switching between mobi and non-mobi windows
- etc.
