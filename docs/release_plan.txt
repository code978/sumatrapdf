Things to do before 1.9 release:
* add splitter between favorites and bookmarks windows (http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1547)
* installer: UI for registering other supported types http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1365
* bug: expansion state for chm documents is not (always ?) preserved. Also, single root toc element is not
  auto-expanded. I think the semantics of DocTocItem.open and tocState for chm is broken and they might
  cancel each other but I never understood why it's so complicated (even for pdf docs). For my taste, DocTocItem.open
  should be whatever default state is (encoded in PDF doc, set via heuristic for chm docs) and
  tocState should be user selected over-ride i.e. if tocState entry exists, that's what we use for UI state. If tocState entry
  doesn't exist we use DocTocItem.open for UI state. But I don't know this code so I'm afraid of introducing regressions.
* bug: focus captured by web control when clicking on "Related Topics" button in 010Editor.chm from
  http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1579
* chm: chm files downloaded from the internet are marked as unsafe by Windows and while they open
  just fine, IE won't render them correctly. We should fix that automatically (or at least ask
  user to let us fix that and refuse to load a file if user doesn't agree). When it happens,
  it trips even me (I tend to forget about that) so I'm sure it will trip up many users.
  This setting must be some security property on a file that we can change. It can be
  changed manually via file properties panel in window (in "General" tab there's
  "Security" text and "Unblock" button).

Things to do before 2.0 release:
* (?) ebook support
