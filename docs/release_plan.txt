Things to do before 2.0 release:

Specific things that still need to be added for minimal mobi support:
- save and restore last position in the mobi file
- document properties
- crash in mobi: HEAP: Free Heap block 70dae8 modified at 70db1c which is +1 at offset
  0x34 (52). Is it InterlockedIncrement() or some other refCount on a freed object?
- mem leak when mobi layout thread is interrupted

Maybe for 2.0:
- progress bar flicker when status line changes width (I think). We probably force repaint after
  re-layout in mui even if position/sizes of controls haven't changed

Things that can wait for 2.1:
- links in mobi format
- lists in mobi format (ul, li)
- search in mobi
- fullscreen for mobi
- printing from mobi
- better way of switching between mobi and non-mobi windows
- etc.
