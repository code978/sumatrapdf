Things to do before 1.9 release:
* add splitter between favorites and bookmarks windows (http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1547)
* installer: UI for registering other supported types http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1365
* bug: focus captured by web control when clicking on "Related Topics" button in 010Editor.chm from
  http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1579
* chm: chm files downloaded from the internet are marked as unsafe by Windows and while they open
  just fine, IE won't render them correctly. We should fix that automatically (or at least ask
  user to let us fix that and refuse to load a file if user doesn't agree). When it happens,
  it trips even me (I tend to forget about that) so I'm sure it will trip up many users.
  This setting must be some security property on a file that we can change. It can be
  changed manually via file properties panel in window (in "General" tab there's
  "Security" text and "Unblock" button).

Things to do before 2.0 release:
