Things to do before 2.0 release:
- crash handler for installer:
 - add installer symbols to symbols zip
 - setup crash handler paths for installer

Maybe for 2.0:
- progress bar flicker when status line changes width (I think). We probably
  force repaint after re-layout in mui even if position/size of controls
  hasn't changed

Things that can wait for 2.1 or later:
- even more mobi document properties
- links in mobi format
- lists in mobi format (ul, li)
- mobi: search
- mobi: fullscreen
- mobi: printing
- better way of switching between mobi and non-mobi windows
- mobi: allow to change default font name/size, remember it
        for a given document in preferences
- mobi: 2 page display
- mobi: rtl support
- etc.

Misc stuff for 2.1 or later:
- rename LayoutInfo => FormatterArgs (HtmlFormatterArgs ?),
  PageData => HtmlPage (?), DrawPageLayout => DrawHtmlPage (?),
  *Layout* => *Format*, PageLayout.[h|cpp] => HtmlFormatter.[h|cpp]
