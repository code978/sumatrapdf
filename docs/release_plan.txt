The idea for the next few releases is to make them relatively quickly,
every 2-3 months.

Major user-visible changes in each release:
2.1 - epub in ebook ui; new translation system as described
      in wishlist.txt
2.2 - fb2 in ebook ui; rebrand as Sumatra Reader
2.3 - text support (in it's own ui)
2.4 - hex display (can show any file in hex/text view; it's own ui)

Note: we could compress all those features into a single release
but the idea is that each release will have as many additional
changes as we can make in 2-3 months but most of them will
be internal refactorings invisible to users or smaller UI tweaks.
Support for an additional format is something that justifies
making another release, which is why it's spaced like this.

More detailed list for 2.1 (code comple target: 5/23, release
target: 6/1):
- refactor LoadDocument() so that more code is shared between
  engine/ebook UIs and so that it loads documents in the
  background thread
- a smoother transition betwen different window types which
  doesn't involve closing the window
- mobi: closing mobi document when initial formatting is going on,
  we loose the position in the file (it gets reset to 0)
- a web-based translation system as described in wishlist.txt
  Server written in Go + python scripts to upload strings for
  translation and download translations

- move to a single-year copyright notice (i.e. "Copyight 2011-2012" =>
  "Copyright 2012". If it's good enough for Google, it's good enough for me.
- ???

Given aggresive schedule, it's important to make the most risky
(most likely to introduce breakage) changes first so that there
is time to stabilize the code. E.g. in 2.1, LoadDocument() 
refactoring is such a change.

A random list of itmes to implement sooner or later:
- even more mobi document properties
- links in mobi format
- lists in mobi format (ul, li)
- mobi: search
- mobi: fullscreen
- mobi: printing
- mobi: allow to change default font name/size, remember it
        for a given document in preferences
- mobi: 2 page display
- ebook ui: rtl support
