Things to do before 1.9 release:
* add splitter between favorites and bookmarks windows (http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1547)
* installer: UI for registering other supported types http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1365
* bug: expansion state for chm documents is not (always ?) preserved. Also, single root toc element is not
auto-expanded. I think the semantics of DocTocItem.open and tocState for chm is broken and they might
cancel each other but I never understood why it's so complicated (even for pdf docs). For my taste, DocTocItem.open
should be whatever default state is (encoded in PDF doc, set via heuristic for chm docs) and
tocState should be user selected over-ride i.e. if tocState entry exists, that's what we use for UI state. If tocState entry
doesn't exist we use DocTocItem.open for UI state. But I don't know this code so I'm afraid of introducing regressions.

Things to do before 2.0 release:
