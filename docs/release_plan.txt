Things to do before 2.0 release:

Specific things that still need to be added for minimal mobi support:
- save and restore last position in the mobi file

Maybe for 2.0:
- progress bar flicker when status line changes width (I think). We probably force repaint after
  re-layout in mui even if position/sizes of controls haven't changed
- even more mobi document properties

Things that can wait for 2.1 or later:
- links in mobi format
- lists in mobi format (ul, li)
- mobi: search
- mobi: fullscreen
- mobi: printing
- better way of switching between mobi and non-mobi windows
- mobi: allow to change default font name/size, remember it
        for a given document in preferences
- mobi: 2 page display
- mobi: rtl support
- etc.
