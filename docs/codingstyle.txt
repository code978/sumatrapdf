Over time Sumatra accrued code using different naming styles.

Let's fix that.

This document describes the naming style we should use in
future code (and, as a low priority, convert existing code
to that style).

Coding styles are always controversial because they are mostly
a matter of opinion.

This coding style follows 2 main principles:
* codify the style that is already used frequently in Sumatra
* clean looking code (which is e.g. why I avoid "_" prefixes or postfixes in names)

The best way for describing naming style is to use examples.

struct ThisIsStruct
{
    bool    firstMember;
    int     second;
    char    seeHowWeAlignNames;
};

class ThisIsClass
{
    bool   firstDataMember;
    int    second;

    bool   ThisIsMethod(int inArgsGoFirst, TCHAR *outArgsGoLast);
};

bool ThisIsFunction(int inArgsGoFirst, int *outArgsGoLast)
{
    bool   variableName = true;
    *outArgsGoLast = 5;
    return variableName;
}

int gThisIsGlobalVariable;

Also, we use spaces, not tabs, with 4 space indentation.

And that's it.
