List of things to do before we can ship CHM support:

* make zoom (both toolbar and menu items) for chm docs work
* hook back/forward menu to HtmlWindow's GoBack()/GoForward()
* make scrolling in html window with cursor up/down etc. work
  (is it a matter of passing the messages through ?).
  Notes: I don't understand how this is supposed to work. Presumably web browser control
  hooked to a hwnd should just handle standard keyboard navigation. I tried
  tried to forward WM_KEYDOWN messages from FrameOnKeydown() to canvas hwnd
  so that they end up in WndProcHtml() but that didn't change anything (i.e.
  messages get through but that doesn't make keyboard scrolling work).
  Maybe the right approach is to implement scrolling on HtmlWindow (example:
  http://code.google.com/p/fidolook/source/browse/trunk/Qm/ui/messageviewwindow.cpp#886)
  and call it from FrameOnKeydown() via DisplayModel

To decide:
* should we use our own context menu or use the one provided by IE ?

Things we can live without for the first release:
* search (it looks like there's a way to get it cheaply if we reuse
  browser's UI for it; probably much harder if we want to preserve
  our own UI).
* printing, although it seems easy to add printing of a single page
  (it's even already in the context menu)

Done:
* a shot of the first page for the purpose of start page. 
  We can render html to a dummy hwnd and get its bitmap.
  Example code that does that: http://codesearch.google.com/#voCiMvIjuFI/IECapt/IECapt/IECapt.cpp
* make the "prev page" button in toolbar work for chm docs
* modify toolbar in chm ui mode to not show non-applicable items
* sync page number and toc with current page
* hook up print menu/toolbar to printing a single page of the document
  (as invoked from context menu)
* be more lenient in parsing ToC trees (many chm docs fail to load)
