List of things to do before we can ship CHM support:

* make a click into the page move the focus (away from the ToC)

Things we can live without for the first release:
* search (it looks like there's a way to get it cheaply if we reuse
  browser's UI for it; probably much harder if we want to preserve
  our own UI).

Done:
* make scrolling with keyboard (left/right/up/down etc.) work
* custom zoom dialog for chm shouldn't have fit page etc.
* after opening chm, set the remembered zoom level
* make zoom (both toolbar and menu items) for chm docs work
* a shot of the first page for the purpose of start page. 
  We can render html to a dummy hwnd and get its bitmap.
  Example code that does that: http://codesearch.google.com/#voCiMvIjuFI/IECapt/IECapt/IECapt.cpp
* make the "prev page" button in toolbar work for chm docs
* modify toolbar in chm ui mode to not show non-applicable items
* sync page number and toc with current page
* hook up print menu/toolbar to printing a single page of the document
  (as invoked from context menu)
* be more lenient in parsing ToC trees (many chm docs fail to load)
* hook back/forward menu to HtmlWindow's GoBack()/GoForward()
* printing, although it seems easy to add printing of a single page
  (it's even already in the context menu)
