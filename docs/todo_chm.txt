List of things to do before we can ship CHM support:

* a shot of the first page for the purpose of start page. 
  We can render html to a dummy hwnd and get its bitmap
* modify toolbar in chm ui mode to not show non-applicable items
* make scrolling in html window with cursor up/down etc. work
  (is it a matter of passing the messages through ?)

To decide:
* should we use our own context menu or use the one provided by IE ?

Things we can live without for the first release:
* search
* printing
