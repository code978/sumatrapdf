Design for new translation system.

The new translation system has 2 goals:
* use less memory
* allow users to test their translations without the need for us to recompile
  the code

The way we save memory:
* using u16 for pointers to translations instead of pointers (for curernt
  translations it saves 48*234*/1024 = 22 kB)
* compressing translations with zip

The way we allow users to test their translations:
* the translations are incorporated into Sumatra as a binary resource
* if the file translations.dat (using the same format as binary resource)
  exists in Sumatra's directory, we'll use it instead

The format of the file with translations is binary, both for compactness
and ease of parsing. The format is:

u32 magic_value - for an easy way to reject 
u32 $strCount - number of strings
u32 $langCount - number of languages
u16 $langCodesSectionLen - size of lang codes section
u16 $langNamesSectionLen - size of lang nams section
[$langCount]u16 - LANG id array
[$langCount]u8 - isLangRTL array

[$langCount*$strCount]u16 

[]byte 

LangData
