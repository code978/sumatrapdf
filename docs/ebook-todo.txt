Things to do for the first version of ebook (mobi) support:
* mobi format: read images
* convert mobi html to an representation optimized for layout/display
* improve layout/display to support all (or at least most)
  features of mobi files (images, bold/italic, different fonts,
  line indent at paragraph start, page breaks, links etc.)
* ui: turn pages
* ui: show position status like in Kindle app ("n% Page N out of M * Location X of Y")
* ui: show scrollbar at the bottom and reacto to it

Things nice to have but can wait for future:
* ui: double page display
* ui: change the font size
* ui: change font/background combinations (just 3 options, like in kindle app:
  black on white, sepia, white on black)
* ui: change brightness
* search
* table of content
* bookmarks
* support epub
* support other formats
* hyphenation (http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/)
