Things to do for the first version of ebook (mobi) support:
* layout bug: the last line on a page seem to go past page bounding box
* mobi: read images
* mobi: read codepage and other metadata
* convert mobi html to an representation optimized for layout/display
* layout: support images
* layout: support bold/italic/underline
* layout: support different fonts
* layout: indent first line of a paragraph
* layout: page breaks
* layout: links
* ui: turn pages
* ui: show position status like in Kindle app ("n% Page N out of M * Location X of Y")
* ui: show scrollbar at the bottom and reacto to it
* layout: do layout on a thread, send laid out pages incrementally. Laying out
  a whole book takes a while, the idea is to be able to display the current
  page as soon as it's available

Things nice to have but can wait for future:
* ui: double page display
* ui: change the font size
* ui: change font/background combinations (just 3 options, like in kindle app:
  black on white, sepia, white on black)
* ui: change brightness
* search
* table of content
* bookmarks
* support epub
* support other formats
* hyphenation (http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/)
