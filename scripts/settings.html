<p>You can change the look and behavior of
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/">SumatraPDF</a>
by editing <code>SumatraPDF.dat</code> settings file.</p>

<p>The file is stored in <code>%APPDATA%\SumatraPDF</code> directory for the
installed version or in the same directory as SumataPDF.exe executable for the
portable version.</p>

<p>The file is in a simple text format. Here's what different settings mean and
what is their default value:</p>

<pre class=txt>
<span class=cm>All values in this structure can't be modified from within the UI and are for 
experimental or expert settings. They're overwritten by the content of 
SumatraPDF-user.ini if that file exists.</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the background might allow to subconsciously
