<p>You can change the look and behavior of
<a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/">SumatraPDF</a>
by editing <code>SumatraPDF.dat</code> settings file.</p>

<p>The file is stored in <code>%APPDATA%\SumatraPDF</code> directory for the
installed version or in the same directory as SumataPDF.exe executable for the
portable version.</p>

<p>The file is in a simple text format. Here's what different settings mean and
what is their default value:</p>

<pre class=txt>
<span class=cm>All values in this structure can't be modified from within the UI and are for 
experimental or expert settings. They're overwritten by the content of 
SumatraPDF-user.ini if that file exists.</span>
UserPrefs [
  <span class=cm>background color of the non-document windows, traditionally yellow</span>
  MainWindowBackground = #fff200

  <span class=cm>whether the Esc key will exit SumatraPDF same as 'q'</span>
  EscToExit = false

  <span class=cm>whether opening a new document should happen in an already running SumatraPDF 
  instance so that there's only one process and documents aren't opend twice</span>
  ReuseInstance = false

  <span class=cm>these values allow to customize the UI used for fixed page documents (PDF, 
  XPS, DjVu, etc.)</span>

    BackgroundColor = #ffffff

    <span class=cm>colors to use for the gradient from top to bottom (stops will be inserted at 
    regular intervals throughout the document); currently only up to three 
    colors are supported; the idea behind this experimental feature is that the 
    background might allow to subconsciously determine reading progress; 
    suggested values: #2828aa #28aa28 #aa2828</span>
